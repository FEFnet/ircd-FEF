Upgrading from charydis 3-based FEF 7.6 to solanum-based FEF 8

A lot of options in general/channel have changed, the privsets have definitely
changed, and the cluster/shared sections are gone.

The easiest way is to copy the example conf, change the name/sid/vhost/vhost6
settings, then replace ONLY the auth/oper/connect blocks with the blocks from
your old config. Those blocks should be 100% drop-in compatible.
